Since 2012 the version 1 exists. There is the promise that in the syntax and the default libraries within a major version no breaking changes exist.

All half year a new Go version is released and supported for one year. Security updates are always provided for the two latest Go versions, i.e. when v1.14 is released, v1.14 and v1.13 is supported and v1.12 gets discontinued.
