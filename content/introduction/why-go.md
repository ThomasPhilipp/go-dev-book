Go's syntax is **small** and **easy to learn**. It is **good documented** and has a **rich tool set** including framworks for testing, static code anlysis, race detector, etc.

Other benefits:
- Fast compilation
- Strict static code checker
- Memory management

A Go application must be compiled. This additional steps has the advantage that it runs directly on a desired host system and do not require an interpreter or a virtual machine. A compiled Go application already contains all necessary parts to run.

The compiler not only creates machine code, it is also responsible to check errors. Go is a static typed language meaning, that the compiler also checks the used types.
