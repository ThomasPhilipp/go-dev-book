Each go installation consists of:

- Compiler
- Default libraries (aka _Standardbibliothek_)
- Tool set

## Tool set

- **gopls**: the official language server which is integrated into IDEs for auto completion, documentation, etc.
- **gofmt**: code formater
- **goimports**: managing imports (which implicitly calls **gofmt**)
